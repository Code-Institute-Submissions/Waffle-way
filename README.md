## UX ( User Experience)
### Project Goals :jigsaw:	
The goal of this project is to inform users of where to find the locations where they can buy waffles or hire a waffle stand for their events. The project is aimed towards families of all ages and event organisers. The website needs to be visually appealing whilst providing a great User Experience to encourage users to visit the company location and use their service.

### User Goals :jigsaw:	
* A website that serves as an informative tool to help users find the details of the product and services
* Send a message via contact form
* Ability to see company location
* Ability to see images of the product
* Ability to read and leave reviews
* Visiual interaction and feedback
* Links to social platforms
* Interact with the website on both Desktop tablet and mobile

## User stories: 	:dart:
* As a user I expect to be able to quickly find the locations and opening times where I can purchase the product
* As a user I want to be able to read reviews and see photos of the product before I decide to make a purchase
* As a user I want to be able to get in touch with the business to ask questions about hiring them
* As a user I expect to see a visual feedback when I press a button 
* As a user I expect to know where on the page I currently am while browsing
* As a user I expet to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

## Site Owner Goals: 	:dart:

  * Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website

## Design choices: :framed_picture:	
The theme of this project is *food*, therefore my design choices are heavily influenced by positive colours and motifs. Using the resources in [this blog](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/colors-proven-to-boost-sales/) I was able to pick out a colour scheme that has been proven to boost sales/interaction with a web page. By using [this webpage](https://coolors.co/) I was able to macth colors for this projcet.
  
**Fonts:**

I chose to use the font Open Sans as it was designed with a neutral, yet friendly appearance which compliments the general attitude of this project's design and it's desired function.  

**Icons:**

The icons used are self explanatory so that the user does not need to struggle to interpret what the icon will actually mean. I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons, to display the classic ‘burger-button’ on tablet and mobile devices.

**Colours:**

Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential sales/leads and interactions. [Link to the colour palette](https://coolors.co/ec7505-fafafa-4e598c-f42b03-f9c784). Screenshot of the colour palette has been added to the wireframes folder [here](https://github.com/bartosz-makowski/Waffle-way/blob/master/wireframes/waffleway-palette.png).

**Colours used:**
* #FAFAFA baby powder - used for backgrounds
* #EC7505 princeton orange
* #4E598C purple navy
* #F42B03 scarlet
* #F9C784 gold crayola

**Images:**

The images I chose to use across the project are sourced from the owner of the Waffle Way, they showcase different types of their products.

## Wireframes: :straight_ruler:
I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. Started by doing a very basic wireframe for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop - these were to get a basic understanding of how structurally elements would appear on the page. You can view this wireframe in a wireframe folder.

## Features: :abacus:
**Features that have been developed:**
* Sliding Modal
* Visible feedback when hover over buttons, links and icons
* Contact form

**Features to be implemented in the future:**
* Blog
* Interactive google maps of the locations
