## UX ( User Experience)
### Project Goals :jigsaw:	
The goal of this project is to inform users of where to find the locations where they can buy waffles or hire a waffle stand for their events. The project is aimed towards families of all ages and event organisers. The website needs to be visually appealing whilst providing a great User Experience to encourage users to visit the company location and use their service.
### User Goals :jigsaw:	
* A website that serves as an informative tool to help users find the details of the product and services
* Send a message via contact form
* Ability to see company location
* Ability to see images of the product
* Ability to read and leave reviews
* Visiual interaction and feedback
* Links to social platforms
* Interact with the website on both Desktop tablet and mobile

## User stories: 	:dart:

#### Mr A:
As a user I expect to be able to quickly find the locations and opening times where I can purchase the product

#### Mrs B:
As a user I want to be able to read reviews and see photos of the product before I decide to make a purchase

#### Mr C:
As a user I want to be able to get in touch with the business to ask questions about hiring them

## Site Owner Goals: 	:dart:

* Improve brand recognition in the local area
* Advertise their product and services
* Receive contact details through use of contact form
* Expose the bussines to cooperation opportunities

## User Requirements and Expectations: 	:dart:

* Requirements
  * Navigate the website using the navbar/pop-out nav
  * Be provided with information of product and location of the business
  * contnent displayed in a visually appealing manor
  
* Expectations
  * Content is visually satisfying and informative on all screen sizes
  * No information overload
  * Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website
  * Burger menu button appeares in place of navbar on tablet and mobile devices
  
## Design choices: :framed_picture:	
The theme of this project is food, therefore my design choices are heavily influenced by positive colours and motifs. Using the resources in this blog (https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/colors-proven-to-boost-sales/) I was able to pick out a colour scheme that has been proven to boost sales/interaction with a web page. By using this webpage (https://coolors.co/) I was able to macth colors for this projcet.
  
Fonts:

I chose to use the font Open Sans as it was designed with a neutral, yet friendly appearance which compliments the general attitude of this project's design and it's desired function.  

Icons:

The icons used are self explanatory so that the user does not need to struggle to interpret what the icon will actually mean. I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons, to display the classic ‘burger-button’ on tablet and mobile devices.

Colours:

Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential sales/leads and interactions

Colors used:
* #FAFAFA off white - used for backgrounds
* #EC7505 orange
* #4E598C purple navy
* #F42B03 red
* #F9C784 pale yellow

Styling:

BEM:
Block element modifier is a way of writing CSS code in order to organise the code into a much more readable format. Head to the credits to read more about BEM style.

Images:

The images I chose to use across the project are sourced from the owner of the Waffle Way, they showcase different types of their products.

## Wireframes: :straight_ruler:
I built the wireframes for this project using Balsamiq. Started by doing a very basic wireframe for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop - these were to get a basic understanding of how structurally elements would appear on the page. You can view this wireframe in a wireframe folder.
