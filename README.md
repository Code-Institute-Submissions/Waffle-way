## UX ( User Experience)
### Project Goals :jigsaw:	
The goal of this project is to inform users of where to find the locations where they can buy waffles or hire a waffle stand for their events. The project is aimed towards families of all ages and event organisers. The website needs to be visually appealing whilst providing a great User Experience to encourage users to visit the company location and use their service.

### User Goals :jigsaw:	
* A website that serves as an informative tool to help users find the details of the product and services
* Send a message via contact form
* Ability to see company location
* Ability to see images of the product
* Ability to read and leave reviews
* Visiual interaction and feedback
* Links to social platforms
* Interact with the website on both Desktop tablet and mobile

## User stories 	:dart:
* As a user I expect to be able to quickly find the locations and opening times where I can purchase the product
* As a user I want to be able to read reviews and see photos of the product before I decide to make a purchase
* As a user I want to be able to get in touch with the business to ask questions about hiring them
* As a user I expect to see a visual feedback when I press a button 
* As a user I expect to know where on the page I currently am while browsing
* As a user I expet to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

## Site Owner Goals	:dart:

* Improve brand recognition in the local area
* Advertise their product and services
* Receive contact details through use of contact form
* Expose the bussines to cooperation opportunities

## User Requirements and Expectations 	:dart:

* **Requirements**
  * Navigate the website using the navbar/pop-out nav
  * Be provided with information of product and location of the business
  * contnent displayed in a visually appealing manor
  
* **Expectations**
  * Content is visually satisfying and informative on all screen sizes
  * No information overload
  * Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website
  * Burger menu button appeares in place of navbar on tablet and mobile devices
  
## Design choices :framed_picture:	
The theme of this project is *food*, therefore my design choices are heavily influenced by positive colours and motifs. Using the resources in [this blog](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/colors-proven-to-boost-sales/) I was able to pick out a colour scheme that has been proven to boost sales/interaction with a web page. By using [this webpage](https://coolors.co/) I was able to macth colors for this projcet.
  
**Fonts**

I chose to use the font **Open Sans** as it was designed with a neutral, yet friendly appearance which compliments the general attitude of this project's design and it's desired function. it can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=welcome+to+waffle+way+&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open&selection.family=Open+Sans:wght@400;600). During the development process we realised a need to place a welcome title on hero image. We choose a **Dancing Script** font from google fonts. It can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dancing+Script?preview.text=welcome+to+waffle+way+&preview.text_type=custom&sidebar.open&selection.family=Dancing+Script|Lobster#glyphs). This font has a friendly informal and spontaneous look that suits the website style well.

**Icons**

The icons used are self explanatory so that the user does not need to struggle to interpret what the icon will actually mean. I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons, to display the classic ‘burger-button’ on tablet and mobile devices.

**Colours**

Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential sales/leads and interactions. [Link to the colour palette](https://coolors.co/ec7505-fafafa-4e598c-f42b03-f9c784). Screenshot of the colour palette has been added to the wireframes folder [here](https://github.com/bartosz-makowski/Waffle-way/blob/master/wireframes/waffleway-palette.png).

**Colours used**
* #FAFAFA baby powder - used for backgrounds
* #EC7505 princeton orange
* #4E598C purple navy
* #F42B03 scarlet
* #F9C784 gold crayola

**Images**

The images I chose to use across the project are sourced from the owner of the Waffle Way, they showcase different types of their products.
During the development process we found the need for additional images with better quality, these were downloaded from free image source at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/waffles) 

## Wireframes :straight_ruler:
I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. Started by doing a very basic wireframe for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop - these were to get a basic understanding of how structurally elements would appear on the page. You can view this wireframe in a wireframe folder [here](https://github.com/bartosz-makowski/Waffle-way/tree/master/wireframes).

### Testing :magnet:

#### Plan
During planning of this project it was certain I had to have a thorough testing plan in place. Thanks to organising the concept in the wireframes I was able to selcet which feature to work on. This allowed me to thoroughly test the implementation of each feature before moving on to the next task. The utilisation of developer tools in Google Chrome allowed me to test each feature and its behaviour on a different screen sizes.
During the development proces this project was tested on various browsers and devices such as Chrome - desktop and mobile, Microsoft Edge - desktop, Mozilla Firefox - desktop, Safari - IPad Pro 9.7 and IPhone XS & 8, Brave - mobile app Samsung S8.

#### Tests
##### Using W3C Markup Validator
###### Test 1
* **Error:** The first child option element of a select element with a required attribute, and without a multiple attribute, and without a size attribute whose value is greater than 1, must have either an empty value attribute, or must have no text content. Consider either adding a placeholder option label, or adding a size attribute with a value equal to the number of option elements.
* **Solution:** Adding ```<option value="">Event type</option>``` as a first child element of a **select** element fixed this problem.
###### Test 2
* **Warning:** The date input type is not supported in all browsers. Please be sure to test, and consider using a polyfill
* **Solution** this input type is quite new and is not supported by older web browsers, however we decided to keep it in this form.

### Bugs :mosquito:

#### Footer alignment :spider:
* **Issue:** During the development process after testing the page on a IPad pro in horizonthal position I noticed that footer icons were not in the center of the display.
* **Fix:** Changing the footer - gavr the footer a ``class="container"``

#### Carousel imgs too large :bug:
* **Issue:** Images in the carousel element were too large.
* **Fix:** Changing a **width** property of **.carousel** fixed this issue and made it more responsive on smaller screens.

#### Known bugs :ant:
* **Issue:** On small screens after pressing burger icon navbar links are partially covering the section headers.
